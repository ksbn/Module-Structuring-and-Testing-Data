let count = 0;

count = count + 1;


// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing
// Answer: Line 3 is an assignment operation, where the equals sign (\(=\)) takes the value on its right side and stores it in the variable on its left. It first calculates the expression on the right side (\(count+1\)), which means it takes the current value of count (which is 0) and adds 1 to it. Then, it assigns this new result (1) to the variable count, effectively updating it's value.
